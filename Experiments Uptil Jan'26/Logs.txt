Updated .gitignore

Tips.docx and Tips2.docx are not visible

Well , 
Since Tips.docx existed before .docx was added to .gitignore
therefore earlier version are retained online
but no new commits(after .gitignore updation) involve .docx now.

19th Jan:

Renamed "index.java" ---> "open.java" but didnot modify the content.
Renamed "Tips.txt" ---> "Logs.txt" AND modified the content of the File.
